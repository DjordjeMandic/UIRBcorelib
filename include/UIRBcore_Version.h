/**
 * @file UIRBcore_Version.h
 * @brief Contains version information for the UIRBcore library.
 *
 * This header file is auto-generated during the installation process and defines the version number
 * of the UIRBcore library. The version is represented using the major, minor, and patch
 * components along with a human-readable string.
 *
 * @details
 * - Version format: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH or MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH-COMMITS-gCOMMIT_HASH
 * - The @ref UIRB_CORE_LIB_VER_STR macro provides the complete version as a string.
 * - Individual macros (@ref UIRB_CORE_LIB_MAJOR, @ref UIRB_CORE_LIB_MINOR, etc.) allow programmatic access
 *   to each version component.
 *
 * @note
 * - Ensure the UIRBcore library is included before using this file.
 * - Do not modify this file manually; it is automatically generated and may be overwritten.
 * - The script retrieves the version from the latest Git tag in the repository. If no tags exist,
 *   the script will fall back to the commit hash.
 * 
 * @warning
 * - This file is regenerated during every installation process. Changes to this file will be lost.

     * @def UIRB_CORE_LIB_VER_STR
     * @brief Full version string of the UIRBcore library.
     * 
     * This macro defines a string representing the full version of the UIRBcore library as retrieved by 
     * the `git describe --tags --dirty --always` command. The version format can take various forms:
     * 
     * **Version Formats:**
     * - **Tagged Commit:**
     *   - `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` (e.g., "1.0.0")
     *   - Optionally prefixed with `v`: `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` (e.g., "v1.0.0").
     * - **Additional Commits Beyond Tag:**
     *   - Includes commit count and hash: 
     *     - `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH-COMMITS-g<COMMIT_HASH>` (e.g., "1.0.0-2-gabc1234")
     *     - `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH-COMMITS-g<COMMIT_HASH>` (e.g., "v1.0.0-2-gabc1234").
     * - **Uncommitted Changes:**
     *   - Appends `-dirty` if the working directory has uncommitted changes (e.g., "1.0.0-dirty").
     * 
     * **Use Case:**
     * - The macro is primarily used for logging, display, and debugging purposes, ensuring visibility 
     *   of the current version state, including details about uncommitted changes or additional commits.
     * 
     * **Note:**
     * - Ensure that the repository contains valid Git tags for meaningful version strings.
     * - If no tags exist, the output will fall back to the latest commit hash.
     * 
     * @see https://git-scm.com/docs/git-describe for details about the `git describe` command.
