/**
 * @file UIRBcore_Version.h
 * @brief Contains version information for the UIRBcore library.
 *
 * This header file is auto-generated during the installation process and defines the version number
 * of the UIRBcore library. The version is represented using the major, minor, and patch
 * components along with a human-readable string.
 *
 * @details
 * - Version format: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH or MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH-COMMITS-gCOMMIT_HASH
 * - The @ref UIRB_CORE_LIB_VER_STR macro provides the complete version as a string.
 * - Individual macros (@ref UIRB_CORE_LIB_MAJOR, @ref UIRB_CORE_LIB_MINOR, etc.) allow programmatic access
 *   to each version component.
 *
 * @note
 * - Ensure the UIRBcore library is included before using this file.
 * - Do not modify this file manually; it is automatically generated and may be overwritten.
 * - The script retrieves the version from the latest Git tag in the repository. If no tags exist,
 *   the script will fall back to the commit hash.
 * 
 * @warning
 * - This file is regenerated during every installation process. Changes to this file will be lost.
