     * @brief Contains definitions and utilities for managing configuration data in EEPROM for the %UIRB system.
     * 
     * The `eeprom` namespace encapsulates all components related to the storage, retrieval, and management 
     * of configuration data in the EEPROM memory of the %UIRB system. It includes:
     * - Data structures representing hardware and software configurations.
     * - Helper functions and utilities for manipulating data stored in EEPROM.
     * - Classes and constants that provide a high-level interface for managing EEPROM data.
     * 
     * @details
     * The namespace is organized to ensure a clear separation of responsibilities, with each component 
     * focusing on specific aspects of EEPROM management. This modular approach simplifies the integration 
     * of new features and ensures consistency across different parts of the system.
     * 
     * **Core Components:**
     * - @ref EEPROMData : A packed structure that stores all hardware and software configurations, 
     *   metadata, and runtime statistics.
     * - @ref HardwareVersion : A compact union representing the hardware version using major and minor 
     *   version numbers.
     * - @ref HardwareManufactureDate : A compact union representing the manufacturing date with a year offset 
     *   from 2020 and the month.
     * - @ref SoftwareConfig : A bitfield union for storing various software configuration flags.
     * - @ref EEPROMDataManager : A high-level class for managing @ref EEPROMData in EEPROM and RAM.
     * - Constants such as @ref EEPROMDataManager::INVALID_CHARGER_PROG_RESISTANCE and @ref EEPROMDataManager::INVALID_MANUFACTURE_MONTH 
     *   for error handling and validation.
     * 
     * **Design Considerations:**
     * - The structures and classes in this namespace are designed to be memory-efficient, leveraging 
     *   packed and aligned data representations.
     * - Each component includes safeguards for data validation and error handling to ensure robust operation.
     * 
     * **Key Features:**
     * - Compact and efficient representations of configuration data.
     * - Flexible and extensible design to accommodate future hardware revisions or feature enhancements.
     * - High-level interfaces for managing EEPROM data with field-specific accessors and mutators.
     * 
     * @note The components in this namespace are tailored specifically for the %UIRB system. While they 
     *       can be adapted for other applications, modifications may be necessary to ensure compatibility.
     * 
     * @see @ref EEPROMDataManager for the main interface to manage EEPROM data.
     * @see @ref EEPROMData for the data structure representing the core configuration.
